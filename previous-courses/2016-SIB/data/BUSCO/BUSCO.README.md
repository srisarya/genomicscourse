bacteria_buscos.tar.gz = tarball with bacterial BUSCO profiles and associated data

STREP-FASTA1.tar.gz = tarball with set1 Streptomyces full gene sets (protein sequences in FASTA format)

STREP-FASTA2.tar.gz = tarball with set3 Streptomyces full gene sets (protein sequences in FASTA format)

STREP-FASTA3.tar.gz = tarball with set3 Streptomyces full gene sets (protein sequences in FASTA format)

Several gzipped bacterial genomes


Info on BUSCO scripts:

launch_all_streps.sh = bash script to sequentially launch BUSCO assessment on each STREP gene set
