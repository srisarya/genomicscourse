CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
-------------------------

    o Preparing package for Bioconductor submission.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.19
-------------------------

    o Added `summarizeToGene` which breaks out the gene-level
      summary step, so it can be run by users on lists of
      transcript-level matrices produced by `tximport` with
      `txOut=TRUE`.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.18
=========================

    o Changed argument `gene2tx` to `tx2gene`.
      This order is more intuitive: linking transcripts to genes,
      and matches the `geneMap` argument of Salmon and Sailfish.
